# Web Development
# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: a Basic Banking System and a Color Identification tool.

## Basic Banking System

The **CBI-Sparks-Foundation** folder contains the Basic Banking System, a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This system displays all transactions conducted within a bank, offering a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing transaction data.

## Color Identification

The **color-identification-main** folder includes a Python-based Color Identification tool that detects and returns the color of a specific pixel within an image. This tool demonstrates how Python can be used for color analysis and image processing tasks.

Both components showcase the application of web development and Python scripting to address practical challenges.
